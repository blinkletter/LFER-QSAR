# LFER-QSAR
Data tables for LFER and QSAR parameters
## Summary
This repsoitory will contain data tables transcribed from literature sources in CSV format. I am adding a data science component to my upper level physical organic course and this will be a place for my students to add to the tables in a collaboartive manner. They will hopefully become more familiar with collaboration tools such as git-hub, where chemists seldom tread.

Along the way my students will vet the tables for errors (both transcription errors and literature errors (we found a few already) and will also experience the sense of pride when other find this data bank useful. Please let us know if you found it helpful.

We will be learning some basic python so that students can use the Pandas library to manipulate and visualize the data. Rather than typing in data from websites and publications each time a plot is made, this repository will enable students to focus more on the big picture. Structure controls reactivity. We will see it in the graphs.

At the beginning we will focus on LFER parameters (Hammett, Brown-Okamoto, Taft, etc.) and will eventually add parameters more useful in QSAR. Synthetic chemistry and medicinal chemistry are clients of physical organic chemistry. Hopefully I will be able to prove that to my students using this data.
