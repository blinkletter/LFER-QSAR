# LFER-QSAR
Data tables for LFER and QSAR parameters
## Summary
This repository will contain **data tables** transcribed from literature sources in **CSV format**. I am adding a data science component to my upper level **physical organic chemistry** course and this will be a place for my students to add to the tables in a collaboartive manner. They will hopefully become more familiar with **collaboration tools** such as git-hub, where chemists seldom tread.

Along the way, my students will vet the tables for **errors** (both transcription errors and literature errors - we found a few already) and will also experience the sense of pride when other find this data bank **useful**. Please let us know if you found it helpful.

We will be learning some basic **python** so that students can use the **Pandas** library to manipulate and visualize the data. Rather than typing in data from websites and publications each time a plot is made, this repository will enable students to focus more on the big picture. The code will be presented in **Jupyter notebooks** that will also be available here. Structure controls reactivity. We will see it in the graphs.

In the beginning, we will focus on **LFER parameters** (Hammett, Brown-Okamoto, Taft, etc.) and will eventually add parameters more useful in **QSAR**. Synthetic chemistry and medicinal chemistry are clients of physical organic chemistry. Hopefully I will be able to prove that to my students using this data.
